I couldn’t talk. When I was just barely two years old, I couldn’t talk. Doctors diagnosed me with oral apraxia—a disorder that prevented me from forming syllables and words. Both my elementary school teachers and parents put me through rigorous speech therapy, significantly helping me sounding out letters and words. But it wasn’t all that helped—it was my love of reading that helped me learn how to speak. 

Don’t get me wrong, I still had my first word when I was a baby and still made gurgles and sounds that made absolutely no sense to adult humans. But I could never make out a single, comprehensible word. I remember in junior kindergarten reading children’s books. My teacher had reading hour, which meant we could read by ourselves or in groups. Me, being a social butterfly back then, chose to read in groups. I remember reading to the other children, who were still learning to read. I, on the other hand, was already pointing to the words on the page and comprehending the subject matter.

My love of reading didn’t stop after that; as I got older, I made time before and after school to read more advanced books. I read Junie B. Jones and Magic Tree House. I read on the bus, at school, at home, at my brother’s Little League baseball games, and I read before bed. After taking speech therapy, I was talking all over the place. But I learned to appreciate reading because reading saved my life voice.

These reading comprehension skills helped me become the college student that I am today. My childhood would have been vastly different without my shelves stocked with books. Books helped me shape who I am and who I want to be. Books made me realize what I love most about myself: writing.

Every year on the first day of school, teachers ask some sort of icebreaker question to get to know the class. Some questions include “what’s your favorite candy bar,” or “if you were stranded on an island, what would be the one thing you can’t live without?” Honestly, I would probably choose a book (after a way to get off the island, of course).

My mom was the one that inspired me to read. She always read a passage, verse, chapter, or book to me before bed. I remember her coming into my room to tuck me in at night and read me a story. But instead of just reading it to me, she’d help sound it out. Now, she’s doing that with hundreds of middle school students each year, inspiring them to read. My mom is the person that made me the reader I am today and truly I am grateful.

I couldn’t talk when I was young. But that didn’t hinder my education. My parents, teachers, and I all believed in me. Parents, read to your children. Encourage them to read with you. Encourage them to pick up a book and never set it down. 18 years from now, they’ll be going off to college all because you put The Very Hungry Caterpillar in their hands.
