If you haven’t read my earlier posts about fighting illiteracy, then you can find them [here](https://medium.com/@olivias_1234/why-is-literacy-important-in-a-childs-life-784bb9f40d83), [here](https://medium.com/@olivias_1234/why-are-books-so-important-3be2647744d8), and [here](https://medium.com/@olivias_1234/why-are-books-so-important-3be2647744d8). They’ll tell you about all these programs that you can get your child into—to get them to read. Simple, right? Reading is Fundamental (RIF) sets up these programs in communities that they think they need them in. But how exactly do they do it? How do they choose which communities and how do they get the money to fund these programs? 

Kappa Kappa Gamma, a women’s fraternity, raises money for RIF and also collects books to give to the organization. Kappa hosts two philanthropy events a year. Their annual kickball tournament, which is held every spring semester, is an event where other organizations on campus can participate in and help raise money. Organizations can also bring books in to donate to Kappa’s book drives.

Kappa isn’t the only organization here on campus that raises money for literacy organizations. Pi Beta Phi, also a women’s fraternity, hosts philanthropy events benefitting another literacy organization, Read Lead Achieve.

Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi have (inter)national chapters that all raise money and awareness for literacy organizations. They have book drives and events that raise thousands of money for RIF and Read Lead Achieve.

How can individuals get involved in raising money? By contacting your Reading is Fundamental local chapter.
